# Jumpstart

## Initial Setup

  * Start Docker for your environment
  * Run `mix setup` to install and set up dependencies
  * Run `docker compose up` in a terminal to run services
  * Run `mix ecto.setup` to create the database and seed it with test data

## Run the Server

  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

The test user that was created can be accessed with the credentials:

  * Email: "user@example.com"
  * Password: "password1234"
